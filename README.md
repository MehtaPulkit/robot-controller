# Robot Controller

This is a simple React application that simulates controlling a robot on a 5x5 grid. The robot can move forward in the direction it is facing and rotate to face any of the four cardinal directions (north, south, east, west). The application is styled using TailwindCSS and uses plain JavaScript.

## Features

- **5x5 Grid**: A grid where the robot can be moved.
- **Robot Movement**: Controls to move the robot forward.
- **Robot Rotation**: Controls to rotate the robot left or right.
- **Minimalist Design**: Styled using TailwindCSS, inspired by Bellroyâ€™s clean and simple design aesthetic.
